# Angular coding challenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3. It's purpose is to serve as the base for a coding challenge for the position of a developer at Agilefox.

This is NOT a timed challenge, this is a best practices challenge. Think about: Interfaces vs Classes, Dry Principles, Solid Principles etc. Complete this before the interview. Purpose of this application is to showcase how you utilize the various features offered by angular framework such as (components, services, directives, routing, forms, etc..) and apply best practices during development cycle. Also, if you could add some unit test to the code that will be really helpful.

## What will you build

You are building an application that gets a random joke from the [icanhazdadjoke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) and displays. The application should have a place to show the joke fetched and a button to fetch these jokes. 

## Instructions:
Implement an area to show the joke fetched from the API and a button which on click would fetch these jokes.

* create a structure for the angular application that you feel would scale well for a large scale application
* use angular services and dependency injection to fetch data
* use templates and components to display data and handle user input
* use proper error handling to display errors from the API
* change the README of this template to tell us more about your approach
* design of the application is not important and as far as the app is usable, we do not lay emphasis on the UX/UI aspect of this challenge

Feel free to try out the API first yourself or jump on the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/fzzZFoHcEcw) to see how this challenge was solved using vanilla JS üê£

- The project comes with base angular project files, enabling you to jump straight away to work with the API. However, there are bonus points for setup, styling changes to make the project better.
- Choose a way of working that suits you most - whether it‚Äôs building it all independently or using the base files; if it‚Äôs coding along the YouTube video or just using it as guidance - there is no one right way to do it.
- Feel free to change up some things if you want to tailor the project to your liking, after all it‚Äôs yours to play with and showoff your skills.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
